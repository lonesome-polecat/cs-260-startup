# CS 260 Notes

### Assignment 1 - Git and GitHub

I learned that merging conflicts is tricky business. I had to reset to an earlier commit because I messed things up too much. That is, however, the true beauty of Git. After doing so, I managed to merge my changes.
I learned a bit of markdown for this assignment. I plan to have good looking .md files, particularly for the README.

### Assignment 2 - Startup Specification

I used Google Slides to create a mock layout of my website and, contrary to my initial fears, it was relatively quick. I was able to come up with a basic layout with basic styling in an hour for 4 different tabs.
Also, I just learned in class that I need to call a third-party server/API.
